### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As Asperger, having a more dominant left side of my brain, i was naturally attracted to Computer Engineering because it is an area focused on problem-solving skills and logical thinking. And, above all, aimed at creating new things. Besides ,since high school, this is my hyper focus: research and learn, mainly, about microcontrollers and IOT, Deep Learning + Neural Networks and Mobile Development for iOS. In my free time, ðŸŽ¤ i am a speaker and activist on the cause of neurodiversity and the autism spectrum, furthermore, my favorite hobby is ðŸŽ¨ drawing surrealistic illustrations and studying singing!
